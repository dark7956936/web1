<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
  the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
  [1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
  alongside HTML and JavaScript.
  [2]CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
  including layout, colors, and fonts.
  [3] This separation can improve content accessibility,
  provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
  enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
  .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
